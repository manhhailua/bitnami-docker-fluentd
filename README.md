# What is Fluentd?

Fluentd is an open source data collector, which lets you unify the data collection and consumption for a better use and understanding of data.
[https://www.fluentd.org](https://www.fluentd.org/)

# TL;DR

```console
$ docker run --name fluentd manhhailua/fluentd:latest
```

You can find the available configuration options in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/work-with-non-root-containers/).

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Fluentd Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/fluentd).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/fluentd:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/fluentd/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/fluentd:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/fluentd:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-fluentd.git#master:1/debian-10'
```

# Connecting to other containers

Using [Docker container networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/), a different server running inside a container can easily be accessed by your application containers and vice-versa.

Containers attached to the same network can communicate with each other using the container name as the hostname.

## Using the Command Line

### Step 1: Create a network

```console
$ docker network create fluentd-network --driver bridge
```

### Step 2: Launch the Blacbox_exporter container within your network

Use the `--network <NETWORK>` argument to the `docker run` command to attach the container to the `fluentd-network` network.

```console
$ docker run --name fluentd-node1 --network fluentd-network bitnami/fluentd:latest
```

### Step 3: Run another containers

We can launch another containers using the same flag (`--network NETWORK`) in the `docker run` command. If you also set a name to your container, you will be able to use it as hostname in your network.


# Configuration

To create an endpoint that collects logs on your host just run:

```console
$ docker run -d -p 24224:24224 -p 24224:24224/udp -v /data:/opt/bitnami/fluentd/log fluentd
```

Default configurations are:

 - configuration file at `/opt/bitnami/fluentd/conf/fluentd.conf`
 - listen port `24224` for Fluentd forward protocol
 - store logs with tag `docker.**` into `/opt/bitnami/fluentd/log/docker.*.log`
 - store all other logs into `/opt/bitnami/fluentd/log/data.*.log`

You can overwrite the default configuration file by mounting your own configuration file on the directory `/opt/bitnami/fluentd/conf`:

```console
$ docker run --name fluentd -v /path/to/fluentd.conf:/opt/bitnami/fluentd/conf/fluentd.conf bitnami/fluentd:latest
```

You can also do this by changing the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-fluentd/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
fluentd:
  ...
  volumes:
    - /path/to/fluentd.conf:/opt/bitnami/fluentd/conf/fluentd.conf
  ...
```

You can also extend the default configuration by importing your custom configuration with the "@include" directive. It is a simple as creating a directory with you custom config files and mount it on the directory `/opt/bitnami/fluentd/conf/conf.d`:

```console
$ docker run --name fluentd -v /path/to/custom-conf-directory:/opt/bitnami/fluentd/conf/conf.d bitnami/fluentd:latest
```

You can also do this by changing the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-fluentd/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
fluentd:
  ...
  volumes:
    - /path/to/custom-conf-directory:/opt/bitnami/fluentd/conf/conf.d
  ...
```

# Environment Variables

Environment variable below are configurable to control how to execute fluentd process:

  - `FLUENTD_CONF`: This variable allows you to specify configuration file name that will be used in -c Fluentd command line option. If you want to use your own configuration file (without any optional plugins), you can do it with this environment variable and Docker volumes (`-v` option of `docker run`).
  - `FLUENTD_OPT`: Use this variable to specify other Fluentd command line options, like -v or -q.
  - `FLUENTD_DAEMON_USER`: The user that will run the `fluentd` process when the container is run as root.
  - `FLUENTD_DAEMON_GROUP`: The group of the user that will run the `fluentd` process when the container is run as root.

# Logging

The Bitnami fluentd Docker image sends the container logs to the `stdout`. To view the logs:

```console
$ docker logs fluentd
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

# Understand the structure of this image

The Bitnami Fluentd Open Source Docker image is built using a Dockerfile with the structure below:

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/minideb:buster
...
COPY prebuildfs /
# Install required system packages and dependencies
RUN install_packages xxx yyy zzz
RUN . /opt/bitnami/scripts/libcomponent.sh && component_unpack "ruby" "a.b.c-0"
RUN . /opt/bitnami/scripts/libcomponent.sh && component_unpack "fluentd" "d.e.f-0"
...
COPY rootfs /
RUN /opt/bitnami/scripts/fluentd/postunpack.sh
...
ENV BITNAMI_APP_NAME="fluentd" ...
EXPOSE 24224 5140
WORKDIR /opt/bitnami/fluentd
USER 1001
...
ENTRYPOINT [ "/opt/bitnami/scripts/fluentd/entrypoint.sh" ]
CMD [ "/opt/bitnami/scripts/fluentd/run.sh" ]
```

The Dockerfile has several sections related to:

- Components installation
- Components static configuration
- Environment variables
- Ports to be exposed
- Working directory and user
  - Note that once the user is set to 1001, unprivileged commands cannot be executed any longer.
- Entrypoint and command
  - Take into account that these actions are not executed until the container is started.

# Customize this image

The Bitnami Fluentd Open Source Docker image is designed to be extended so it can be used as the base image for your custom Fluentd containers.

> Note: Read the [previous section](#understand-the-structure-of-this-image) to understand the Dockerfile structure before extending this image.

## Extend this image

Before extending this image, please note there are certain configuration settings you can modify using the original image:

- Settings that can be adapted using environment variables. For instance, you can modify the Fluentd command-line options setting the environment variable `FLUENTD_OPT`.
- [Replacing the default configuration file by mounting your own configuration file ](#configuration).

If your desired customizations cannot be covered using the methods mentioned above, extend the image. To do so, create your own image using a Dockerfile with the format below:

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/fluentd
## Put your customizations below
...
```

Here is an example of extending the image installing custom Fluentd plugins:

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/fluentd
LABEL maintainer "Bitnami <containers@bitnami.com>"

## Install custom Fluentd plugins
RUN fluent-gem install 'fluent-plugin-docker_metadata_filter'
```

# Maintenance

## Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of fluentd, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

### Step 1: Get the updated image

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/fluentd:latest
```

### Step 2: Stop and backup the currently running container

Stop the currently running container using the command

```console
$ docker stop fluentd
```

Next, take a snapshot of the persistent volume `/path/to/fluentd-persistence` using:

```console
$ rsync -a /path/to/fluentd-persistence /path/to/fluentd-persistence.bkp.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H.%M.%S)
```

You can use this snapshot to restore the database state should the upgrade fail.

### Step 3: Remove the currently running container

```console
$ docker rm -v fluentd
```

### Step 4: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image, [restoring your backup](#restoring-a-backup) if necessary.

```console
$ docker run --name fluentd bitnami/fluentd:latest
```
